# derivexex


## Motivation
inspired by [this](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/05/reth-exex) great Paradigm article, I've decided to build this minimal Rollup Derivation Pipeline specifically for [Unichain](https://www.unichain.org/), even though it can be easily abstracted to be usable across other op-stack L2's
